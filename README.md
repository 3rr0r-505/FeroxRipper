**FeroxRipper** is a fast, efficient dictionary-based hash cracker built with Rust. It supports multiple hash algorithms and is designed to break hashes through brute force and dictionary attacks.


## Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Support**: Crack various hash algorithms, including MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and more.
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Use custom wordlists to attempt cracking hashes.
- **Speed & Efficiency**: Built with Rust for high performance and low latency.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable to add more hash algorithms or custom cracking strategies.

## Supported Hash Algorithms

- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA256
- SHA512
- bcrypt
- ... and more to come!
